# EnableInputSuppression

Use to enable input suppression on a modern standby device with a clamshell form factor when the lid is closed, there is no external monitor connected, and the device is on DC power. 

## Aliases and setting visibility

* **Windows Provisioning:** `EnableInputSuppression`
* **Hidden setting:** Yes

## Values

| Value                 | Description                                    |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| 1                     | Enable input suppression. |
| 0                     | Disable input suppression (default). |

## Remarks

When a modern standby device's lid is closed, there is no external monitor connected, and the device is on DC power, it is expected that the device will stay in a low power state to preserve battery life. However, some input devices can wake the system from standby even if the user is not using them. For example, a Bluetooth mouse paired with the device may be stored inside a laptop bag with the device, and the motion of the mouse causes the device to wake. Enabling input suppression prevents this behavior. 

## Applies to

Available in Windows 10, version 1803 and later versions of Windows.
